Possible errors: 
-When evaluating a function and you enter an infinite loop, error. 
    eg, when A1 = SUM(A2, A3) and A2 = SUM(A1, A3) or A1 = SUM(A1, A2)

Basic math operations between two cells:

To index the web-based spreadsheet, we can think of it as a matrix. 
    - 

If a math function finds a string, the program shouldn't crash:
    - If a range of values has some strings in it, we should ignore the strings and do operations solely on entries that are numbers
    - Functionality: What should AVG(5, 's', 4) give? should it be 4.5 or 3?
    - AVG('s') = 0, possible edge case

Parsing user input:
    - things starting with an '='
    - do evaluate on each cell
    - if no

When user wants to overwrite a cell, pop up a dialog making sure user intended that action

Time permitting: make the table have two headings
Structure would look like 
<table>
    <tr> 
        <td></td>
        <th scope = "col"> 1 </th>
        ...
        <th scope = "col"> 50 </th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <th scope = "row> A </th>
        <td> stuff </td>
        ...
        <td> stuff </td>
    </tr>

    ...

    <tr>
        <th scope = "row> Z </th>
        <td> stuff </td>
        ...
        <td> stuff </td>
    </tr>
</table>
